# Django-E-commerce
<b>Predatory Plants Shop</b>. This is my first "mature" application written primarily based on DJANGO. In front of you is a shop with insectivorous plants. The payment system is based on the STRIPE module. This application is not finished, but already fully functional. Probably there are some errors and typos hidden here and there. If you find one, please let me know. I will correct the rest in version two.


I have ambitious plans for it:


- Adding the BLOG module
- Adding missing or empty pages (e.g. stationary shops)
- Creating a CRUD running inside the application, not via Django.admin
- Integration with PayPal
- Something else I will probably come up with.

 


<br>
The application is hosted on a hosting service, but you can download it and test it yourself.<br>



<b>SETUP</b>(as if someone didn't know that)<b>:</b>


To run setup first create virtual environment<br>
  <i>py -m venv venv</i>


Then, after your venv folder is created open it by<br>
  <i>venv\scripts\activate</i>


And then install requirements included in filde requirements.txt<br>
  <i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i>


After instalation complete you can run server with project<br>
  <i>py manage.py runserver</i>
  
  
  
  I also created two accounts, an administrator and a normal user.
  
  SUPERUSER:<br>
  <i>email : a@a.com
  password : admin123</i>
  
  REGULAR USER:<br>
  <i>email b@b.com
  password : user1234</i>
  
  
  Another update soon...(i hope)
